README for package: custom_wrpg

Implements White Rabbit PULSE Generator:

NB: this is a SPARSE PULSE PATTERN: up to 256 states, up to 60s duration.

States can be 
32 bit (output on single DIO482, site 6) or
64 bit (output on DIO482 in site 5 and site 6)

WRGPG is programmed by an STL:
TIME,STATE32[,STATE32]

TIME is a count of WR1MHz starting at WRTT where

WR1MHz is a 1MHz clock derived from White Rabbit
WRTT is the White Rabbit Time Trigger set concurrently on all participating ACQ2106 units.

Control by loading STL to one of the following Fixed Ports
4606 : loads a 32 bit STL to the DIO482 in Site 6
4656 : loads a 64 bit STL to the DIO482 in Site 5 and Site 6.

NB: while other sites, other widths are in theory possible, they are not catered for.
If another combination is required, please contact D-TACQ for advice.

Default boot configuration is via 
/usr/local/CARE/WRPG/config_wrpg

May be overridden by the user as 
/mnt/local/config_wrpg

COMPATIBILITY:

WRPG runs a Sparse Pattern Generator. The time intervals come from the 
Gate Pulse Generator GPG, a hardware STL machine

The STATES are output from the DIO482 32 bit DIO module.

This means that the GPG should not be used for other purposes when WRPG is active.
This means that the standard DPG function "Digital Waveform" should not be enabled.
